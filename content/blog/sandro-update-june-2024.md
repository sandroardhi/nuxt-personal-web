# Hello, this is your captain speaking.

Today, i finished my first course, a Nuxt Mastery course. It was okay, i learn a lot of things. I hope this will open up many path for me.

Well these days i am busy preparing the Beasiswa Semesta test.. i really hope i am one of the few lucky people who got the chance to continue their study.

## What are you preparing? are u even doing anything?

Well yea i was doing *something* obviously. I borrow my best friend's wangsit books for my study. It's rough tho.. the material and test question is so mindblowing to me, i hope i can conquer these wangsit books... there is 3 of these books btw, one for language and text comprehension, one book for cognitive tests, and the last book is for math test. The most difficult, you guess it, is the math book, i am now solely focusing on that book. I hope i make it.

## Thats it for todays update

Bye you guys, thx for reading this!
